## Overview

In this HTML CSS challenge, I recreate the design in the screenshot and make it responsive across multiple screens.

## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Media Queries
- Relative units

### What I learned

Practiced using psuedo selectors for styling buttons.

```css
.btn:hover, .btn-primary:active {
    color: var(--green);
    background-color: var(--grey-800);
    border: 2px solid var(--grey-700);
    box-shadow: 0px 3px 6px var(--grey-900);
    cursor: pointer;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to further sharpen my skills on flex and grid layouts, as well as, CSS styling. Then move onto frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Full Course](https://youtu.be/-G-zic_LS0A) - This helped me learn the fundamentals of CSS. I gained a deep understanding of the three pillars of responsive design - relative units, fluid layouts, and media queries.
